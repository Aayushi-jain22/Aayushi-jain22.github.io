          <h2>Chicken</h2>
              Chicken is one of the most common meats that is prevalent all around the world. It is a white meat that can be prepared in various ways and is easily available almost everywhere you go. While you might have enjoyed it in various forms and might also have some favorites, have you ever stopped to count the health benefits of including chicken in your diet? Here are some of the top health benefits of chicken you may find impressive.Chicken has been domesticated and consumed as food for probably thousands of years. There are many varieties including free-range chicken, organic chicken, and conventional chicken, and the differences between them relate to how they are fed and raised. Free-range chickens, as the term implies, are allowed to roam freely in the pastures. On the other hand, conventional chickens, controversially, are kept in cages and not allowed to move freely. Conventionally raised birds are often injected with hormones to speed growth and are sometimes kept in unhygienic and unhealthy conditions meaning they are also often treated with antibiotics.Of the three, the organic variety is the most expensive because they must have access to the outdoors, are only allowed to eat organically grown food (with no pesticides), and they may not be given antibiotics. They are also supposed to be kept in healthy and clean conditions and allowed to grow naturally.A food rich in protein, chicken can help with weight management and reduce the risk of heart disease. Chicken contains the amino acid tryptophan, which has been linked to higher levels of serotonin (the “feel good” hormone) in our brains.Chicken meat is one of the leading sources of proteins among authentic Latin American cuisine. Nutritionists indicate that chicken breast contains 21 grams of protein per 100 grams, which is not common in other foods. Proteins rank among the best food consumed by human beings, especially when it comes to health-related issues. Amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins, are major bodybuilders and muscle generators.Another health benefit of chicken meat is it plays a significant role in weight management. Any high-protein diet, such as chicken wings, is very useful in weight loss and weight management. Studies show that people who consume high protein food easily manage their weight without problems. If you are struggling with belly fat and excessive weight gain, you need to look for the best chicken wings to reverse the trend.Healthy chicken wings do not only provide sufficient proteins to the body, but they generate necessary vitamins and minerals. B Vitamins, which are in large quantities, play a vital role in energy production and the formation of healthy red blood cells. Vitamin D in chicken wings helps in calcium absorption and the formation of strong bones. Other essential minerals such as iron are essential in muscle activity, hemoglobin formation, and preventing anemia.The lean protein in chicken is an excellent source of amino acids. Our bodies use amino acids to build muscle tissue, something that is particularly important as we age. Studies have also shown that higher protein intake helps to maintain bone mineral density. Eating chicken can help to build stronger muscles and promote healthier bones, decreasing the risk of injuries and diseases such as osteoporosis.Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.
